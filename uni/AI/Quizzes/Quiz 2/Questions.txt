Using the Heart_Disease dataset and Pandas:
	1.	Convert any categorical values into numeric values for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
	2.	Normalize the feature ranges to avoid negatively influencing the model’s efficiency. Modify your code to handle this requirement.
	3.	Visualize the correlation between features in the dataset.
	4.	Based on the correlation results, select the most valuable features and remove the redundant ones to improve the model’s performance.
	5.	Provide the final DataFrame after applying all the preprocessing requirements. Ensure the column arrangement remains the same after any updates.
